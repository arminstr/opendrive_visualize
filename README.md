# OpenDrive ROS Visualizer

This ROS Node publishes all roads based on their geometries. Currently only geometries of type LINE are supported. 

The currently intended use is the visulaization of converted CommonRoad Benchmark files.

The path to the Map file can be configured in the config/params.yaml file.
